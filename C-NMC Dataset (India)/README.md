# Dataset Description

## General Description

* **Name**: C-NMC Dataset
* **Detailed Description**: A	dataset	of	cells	with	labels	(normal	versus	cancer)	is	provided	to	train	machine	learning-based	
classifier	to	identify	normal	cells	from	leukemic	blasts	(malignant/cancer	cells).	These	cells	have	
been	 segmented	 from	 the	microscopic	 images.	These	 images	are	 representative	 of	 images	 in	
the	 real-world	 because	 these	 contain	 some	 staining	 noise	 and	 illumination	 errors,	 although	
these	 errors	 have	 largely	 been	 fixed	 by	 us	 via	 our	 own	 in-house	 method	 of	 stain	 color	
normalization. The	ground	truth	has	been	marked	by	an	expert	oncologist.
