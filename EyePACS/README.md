# Dataset Description

## General Description

* **Name:** EYEPACS Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset
* **Detailed Description:** A large set of high-resolution retina images taken under a variety of imaging conditions. A left and right field is provided for every subject. Images are labeled with a subject id as well as either left or right (e.g. `1_left.jpeg` is the left eye of patient id 1). A clinician has rated each image for the severity of diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4:
  - 0 - No DR
  - 1 - Mild
  - 2 - Moderate
  - 3 - Severe
  - 4 - Proliferative DR
