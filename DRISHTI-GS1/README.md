# Dataset Description

## General Description

* **Name**: DHRISHI-GS1
* **Detailed Description**: Drishti-GS is a dataset meant for validation of segmenting OD, cup and detecting notching.  The images in the Drishti-GS dataset have been collected and annotated by Aravind Eye hospital, Madurai, India. This dataset is of a single population as all subjects whose eye images are part of this dataset are Indians.

The dataset is divided into two: a training set and a testing set of images. Training images (50) are provided with groundtruths for OD and Cup segmentation and notching information.
