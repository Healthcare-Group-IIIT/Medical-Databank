## General Description

* **Name**: COVID-19 POCUS Ultrasound Dataset
* **Detailed Description**: The dataset contains lung ultrasound images and videos. The dataset is assembled from publicly available resources in the web as well as from publications. This complements the current data collection initiaves that only focus on CT or X-Ray data. The data includes a total of >150 videos and >30 images of 3 classes (COVID-19, pneumonia, healthy lungs). With frame-based prediction models this easily makes up for a dataset of 2000 images.
