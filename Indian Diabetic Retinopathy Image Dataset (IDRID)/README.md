# Dataset Description

## General Description

* **Name**: Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset
* **Detailed Description**: IDRiD (Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image Dataset), is the first database representative of an Indian population. Moreover, it is the only dataset constituting typical diabetic retinopathy lesions and also normal retinal structures annotated at a pixel level. This dataset provides information on the disease severity of diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic macular edema for each image. This makes it perfect for development and evaluation of image analysis algorithms for early detection of diabetic retinopathy.
