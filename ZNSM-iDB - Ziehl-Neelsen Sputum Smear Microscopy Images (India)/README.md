# Dataset Description

## General Description

* **Name**: ZNSM-iDB: Ziehl-Neelsen Sputum Smear Microscopy Image Database
* **Detailed Description**: The database contains diverse categories of image datasets with both medium and high noise backgrounds. It possesses datasets for all three processes required for automated microscope development. Standard protocols were used to acquire the images,6 and the datasets were validated by various automated microscopy algorithms to establish their robustness. This database can be used to develop and evaluate efficient and robust algorithms related to automated microscopy.

Digital images of viewfields from 10 different ZN-stained sputum smear slides (belonging to tuberculosis positive patients) were acquired under the guidance of two expert microscopists. Triplicate data for each category were collected using three different microscopes at 
100× magnification. The objective lens with 100× magnification was used as the typical Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli width and length of about 0.5 and 2 − 4 μm, respectively. 29 Images were acquired in RGB (red, green, and blue) color space with “.jpg” file-format.
