Dataset Description
===================
General Description
-------------------
* __Name__ : Patients Metadata for samples sequenced
* __Detailed Description__ : This dataset can help us understand the epidemiology of the COVID-19 virus. The dataset has a detailed description of the case's location and its current status as well. A brief history of the patients travel history is also provided. This can help us understand the trend in death/recovery ratios in various states as well. A time series analysis of the spread can also be done. Using the accession IDs, the COVID-19 genome extracted from the patient can help in virus pathogenicity analysis as well.
